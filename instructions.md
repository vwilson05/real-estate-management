# Feature: Calendar Integration

## Overview
The Calendar Integration feature will provide an interactive calendar to display all property-related events such as issues, repairs, tax due dates, inspections, and more. It will allow users to add, view, edit, and manage date-specific events, and it will include a dedicated page to display upcoming month and week views. Additionally, the feature includes due date notifications via email to ensure timely reminders.

## Feature Description
Integrate a robust calendar system into the Real Estate Portfolio Tracker that:
- **Displays Events:** Shows all events such as property repairs, issues, tax due dates, and inspections.
- **Event Management:** Enables users to add, modify, and delete events with date-specific details.
- **Multiple Views:** Offers a dedicated page with month and week views for planning and monitoring upcoming events.
- **Notifications:** Sends email reminders for events approaching their due dates, allowing for customizable intervals.

## Design Instructions

### 1. Calendar Display
- **Component Integration:**  
  - Implement a calendar component that aggregates events from various categories.
  - Provide filters to view events by category (e.g., repairs, taxes, inspections, issues).
- **User Views:**  
  - Create responsive monthly and weekly views that can adapt to both desktop and mobile screens.
  - Ensure clear visual indicators for different event types.

### 2. Event Management
- **CRUD Operations:**  
  - Allow users to create new events by specifying title, description, date, and category.
  - Enable editing and deletion of existing events.
- **User Interface:**  
  - Maintain an intuitive UI for event addition and modification.
  - Follow the guidelines provided in `ui_ux.md` for consistency and accessibility.

### 3. Notification System
- **Due Date Reminders:**  
  - Configure an email notification system to alert users about upcoming events such as property taxes or inspections.
  - Allow users to customize reminder intervals (e.g., 1 day, 3 days, or 1 week in advance).
- **Backend Logic:**  
  - Develop backend endpoints to trigger notifications based on event due dates.

## Development Plan

### Component Selection & Integration
- **Research Options:**  
  - Evaluate calendar libraries/components that meet the needs (e.g., FullCalendar, custom React/Vue components).
- **Integration:**  
  - Integrate the chosen calendar component into the project, ensuring smooth interaction with the rest of the application.

### API and Database Enhancements
- **Extend Endpoints:**  
  - Add CRUD endpoints for managing calendar events in the backend.
- **Schema Updates:**  
  - Extend the database schema to include calendar events, linking them to specific properties if necessary.

### Notification Setup
- **Email Configuration:**  
  - Implement email services (using SMTP, SendGrid, etc.) to dispatch notifications.
- **Scheduling Logic:**  
  - Develop logic to determine when email reminders should be sent based on the current date and event due dates.

## Testing and UAT

### Unit & Integration Testing
- **API Testing:**  
  - Write unit tests for all new endpoints related to calendar event management.
- **Calendar Functionality:**  
  - Ensure the calendar displays events correctly and that CRUD operations work as intended.
- **Notification Testing:**  
  - Validate email notification triggers and delivery under various scenarios.

### User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
- **Usability:**  
  - Confirm that the UI is intuitive and that users can easily navigate the calendar and add events.
- **Functionality:**  
  - Test filtering, event modification, and removal to ensure a seamless user experience.
- **Email Notifications:**  
  - Verify that reminders are sent out correctly, and that users can modify notification settings.

## Deployment Considerations
- **Incremental Rollout:**  
  - Deploy the calendar integration in a staging environment, thoroughly testing with real data.
- **Monitoring:**  
  - Monitor for potential issues with event display and notifications post-deployment.
- **Documentation:**  
  - Update `documentation.md` and `changelog.md` with details of the new calendar integration feature.

## Additional Considerations
- **Security & Permissions:**  
  - Ensure proper security measures are in place to allow only authorized modifications to calendar events.
- **Customization & Extensions:**  
  - Consider future capabilities such as recurring events and external calendar integrations (e.g., Google Calendar).
- **Performance:**  
  - Optimize the calendar component for fast load times and smooth interactions, even with a large number of events.
