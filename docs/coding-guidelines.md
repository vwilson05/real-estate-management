## Overview
These guidelines ensure consistency, clarity, and maintainability throughout the project.

## Code Style
- **Indentation:** Use 2 or 4 spaces consistently per indentation level.
- **Naming Conventions:** 
  - Variables and functions: camelCase or snake_case (choose one and stick to it).
  - Classes: PascalCase.
- **Commenting:** 
  - Use inline comments sparingly.
  - Write meaningful block comments to describe complex logic.
- **Formatting:** Follow the standard style guide for your chosen language (e.g., PEP8 for Python, Airbnb style for JavaScript).

## Version Control
- **Commit Messages:** Write clear, actionable commit messages.
- **Branching Strategy:** 
  - Use feature branches.
  - Commit early and often.
  - Merge only after thorough code review and testing.

## Testing
- **Unit Testing:** Write tests for critical functions and modules.
- **Integration Testing:** Verify that combined components interact correctly.
- **Documentation:** Ensure that test cases and their usage are clearly documented.
