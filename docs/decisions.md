# Architectural Decisions and Development Pathways

## Client-Server Component Architecture

### Decision: Use Client Components for Interactive Features
- **Context**: Next.js 14 uses React Server Components by default, but interactive features require client-side JavaScript.
- **Decision**: Mark components that use client-side libraries (React Query, React Hook Form, Tremor) with the "use client" directive.
- **Implementation**: Added "use client" directive to:
  - PropertyList.tsx
  - PropertyForm.tsx
  - useProperties.ts
  - PropertiesClient.tsx
- **Rationale**: Ensures proper hydration and prevents serialization errors when passing data between server and client components.

### Decision: Create Client-Side Wrappers for Server Components
- **Context**: Server components cannot directly use client-side libraries or pass non-serializable objects to client components.
- **Decision**: Create client-side wrapper components that encapsulate client-side functionality.
- **Implementation**: Created PropertiesClient.tsx to wrap the server-side properties page.
- **Rationale**: Maintains a clean separation between server and client components while allowing server components to render client components.

## State Management

### Decision: Use React Query for Data Fetching and Caching
- **Context**: Need efficient data fetching, caching, and state management for properties.
- **Decision**: Implement React Query for data fetching, caching, and mutations.
- **Implementation**: Created useProperties hook that uses React Query for fetching and mutating property data.
- **Rationale**: Provides automatic caching, refetching, and optimistic updates with minimal boilerplate.

### Decision: Centralize React Query Provider
- **Context**: React Query requires a QueryClientProvider to be available to all components using React Query.
- **Decision**: Create a centralized Providers component that wraps the application.
- **Implementation**: Created providers.tsx with QueryClientProvider and updated layout.tsx to use it.
- **Rationale**: Ensures consistent state management across the application and prevents multiple QueryClient instances.

## Form Handling

### Decision: Use React Hook Form with Zod for Form Validation
- **Context**: Need robust form validation with good developer experience.
- **Decision**: Implement React Hook Form with Zod for schema validation.
- **Implementation**: Created PropertyForm component with React Hook Form and Zod validation.
- **Rationale**: Provides type-safe form validation with good error handling and developer experience.

## API Design

### Decision: Use Next.js API Routes for Backend
- **Context**: Need a simple backend API for property management.
- **Decision**: Implement Next.js API routes for property CRUD operations.
- **Implementation**: Created /api/properties route with GET and POST handlers.
- **Rationale**: Leverages Next.js built-in API routes for a unified development experience.

### Decision: Implement In-Memory Storage for MVP
- **Context**: Need a simple storage solution for the MVP.
- **Decision**: Use in-memory array for property storage.
- **Implementation**: Created an array in the API route to store properties.
- **Rationale**: Allows rapid development and testing without database setup, with a clear path to replace with a database later.

## UI Components

### Decision: Use Tremor for UI Components
- **Context**: Need a modern, responsive UI with minimal custom CSS.
- **Decision**: Implement Tremor components for UI elements.
- **Implementation**: Used Tremor components (Card, Table, Button, etc.) throughout the application.
- **Rationale**: Provides a consistent, modern UI with minimal custom CSS and good developer experience.

## Type Safety

### Decision: Use TypeScript Throughout
- **Context**: Need type safety and good developer experience.
- **Decision**: Use TypeScript for all components, hooks, and API routes.
- **Implementation**: Added proper TypeScript types to all components and functions.
- **Rationale**: Provides type safety, better IDE support, and catches errors at compile time.

### Decision: Use Zod for Runtime Type Validation
- **Context**: Need runtime type validation for API requests and form data.
- **Decision**: Use Zod for schema validation.
- **Implementation**: Created propertySchema with Zod and used it for validation.
- **Rationale**: Provides runtime type validation with good error messages and TypeScript integration.

## Future Considerations

### Database Integration
- Replace in-memory storage with a proper database (e.g., PostgreSQL with Prisma)
- Implement proper data persistence and querying

### Authentication and Authorization
- Implement user authentication
- Add role-based access control for properties

### Testing
- Add unit tests for components and hooks
- Add integration tests for API routes
- Add end-to-end tests for critical user flows

### Performance Optimization
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Add pagination for property lists
- Optimize bundle size

### Feature Enhancements
- Add property detail view
- Implement property editing
- Add property deletion with confirmation
- Add sorting and filtering to property list
- Implement property search
