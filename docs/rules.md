# AI Coding True North: Guiding Principles

These 10 rules serve as our true north—the fundamental principles guiding our approach to AI coding. They are designed to ensure not only the success of our projects but also the continuous growth and excellence of our craft.

## 1. Fix Things at the Cause, Not the Symptom
Address underlying root problems rather than patching over them. By tackling issues at their source, you improve the long-term stability and maintainability of your code.

## 2. Don’t Be Helpful, Be Better
Move beyond merely meeting requirements. Strive to exceed expectations through innovative solutions and pushing the boundaries of quality and performance.

## 3. Write Better Code
Invest in clear, maintainable, and scalable code. Every line should demonstrate thoughtfulness and precision, ensuring that future modifications and optimizations are straightforward.

## 4. No Workarounds, No Duct Tape
Reject quick fixes that compromise the integrity of the system. Instead, implement robust solutions that stand the test of time and reduce technical debt.

## 5. Embrace Simplicity
Favor simple, straightforward solutions over unnecessary complexity. Clean and simple code is easier to understand, debug, and extend.

## 6. Prioritize Clarity Over Cleverness
While clever solutions might seem appealing, clarity is paramount. Code should be self-explanatory and accessible to others, ensuring long-term maintainability and team collaboration.

## 7. Continuous Learning and Improvement
Adopt a mindset of perpetual growth. Refactor regularly, seek feedback, stay updated with industry practices, and always be willing to learn new techniques and technologies.

## 8. Write Comprehensive Tests
Robust testing is the backbone of reliable software. Develop and maintain thorough test suites to ensure your code performs as expected and to catch issues early.

## 9. Respect Design Principles and Best Practices
Adhere to established coding standards, design principles, and documentation guidelines. Solid foundations make for resilient and extensible systems.

## 10. Own Your Decisions
Take responsibility for your work. Document your design decisions, trade-offs, and lessons learned. Accountability leads to better code, greater transparency, and continuous improvement.
