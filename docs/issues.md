## Module Import Error in PropertyList Component

### Issue Description
**Date**: [Current Date]  
**Status**: Resolved  
**Priority**: High  
**Component**: PropertyList.tsx

The application failed to compile with the following error:

```
Failed to compile
./src/app/properties/components/PropertyList.tsx:5:0
Module not found: Can't resolve '../../../hooks/useProperties'
  3 | import { Table, TableHead, TableRow, TableHeaderCell, TableBody, TableCell, Button } from "@tremor/react";
  4 | import Link from "next/link";
> 5 | import { useProperties, Property } from "../../../hooks/useProperties";
  6 |
  7 | export default function PropertyList() {
  8 |   const { properties, isLoading, error } = useProperties();
```

This error occurred during the build process and can only be dismissed by fixing the error.

### Root Cause
The import path for the `useProperties` hook was incorrect. The component was trying to import from `../../../hooks/useProperties`, but the actual path should be `../../hooks/useProperties` since the hooks directory is at the app level, not at the properties level.

### Resolution
1. Updated the import path in PropertyList.tsx from:
   ```typescript
   import { useProperties, Property } from "../../../hooks/useProperties";
   ```
   to:
   ```typescript
   import { useProperties, Property } from "../../hooks/useProperties";
   ```

2. This change aligns with our architectural decision to keep hooks at the app level for better organization and reusability.

### Prevention
To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Follow the established project structure where hooks are placed in the app-level hooks directory
2. Use relative imports carefully, counting directory levels correctly
3. Consider using path aliases in tsconfig.json for more reliable imports

### Related Architectural Decision
This issue relates to our decision documented in decisions.md regarding the organization of hooks and client components. The resolution reinforces our approach of keeping hooks at the app level for better maintainability and reusability.

## Module Import Error in Transactions Page

### Issue Description
**Date**: [Current Date]  
**Status**: In Progress  
**Priority**: High  
**Component**: transactions/page.tsx

The application failed to compile with the following error:

```
тип ./src/app/transactions/page.tsx:1:0
Module not found: Can't resolve '../components/transactions/TransactionList'
> 1 | import TransactionList from '../components/transactions/TransactionList';
  2 | import TransactionForm from '../components/transactions/TransactionForm';
  3 |
  4 | export default function TransactionsPage() {
```

This error occurred during the build process and can only be dismissed by fixing the error.

### Root Cause
The import path for the `TransactionList` component is incorrect. The component is trying to import from `../components/transactions/TransactionList`, but this path doesn't exist in the project structure. Based on our project structure, components should be organized within their respective feature directories.

### Resolution
1. Create the necessary directory structure:
   ```
   src/app/transactions/components/
   ```

2. Create the TransactionList component in the correct location:
   ```
   src/app/transactions/components/TransactionList.tsx
   ```

3. Update the import path in transactions/page.tsx from:
   ```typescript
   import TransactionList from '../components/transactions/TransactionList';
   ```
   to:
   ```typescript
   import TransactionList from './components/TransactionList';
   ```

4. Similarly, update the import path for TransactionForm:
   ```typescript
   import TransactionForm from './components/TransactionForm';
   ```

### Prevention
To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Follow the established project structure where components are placed in their respective feature directories
2. Use consistent import paths across the application
3. Consider using path aliases in tsconfig.json for more reliable imports

### Related Architectural Decision
This issue relates to our decision documented in decisions.md regarding the organization of components. The resolution reinforces our approach of keeping components within their respective feature directories for better maintainability and organization.

## CSS Border Class Error

### Issue Description
**Date**: [Current Date]  
**Status**: Resolved  
**Priority**: High  
**File**: src/app/globals.css

The application failed to build with the following error:

```
./src/app/globals.css:1:1
Syntax error: /Users/victorwilson/Desktop/projects/personal/re-portfolio-management/src/app/globals.css The `border-border` class does not exist. If `border-border` is a custom class, make sure it is defined within a `@layer` directive.
```

This error occurred during the build process and can only be dismissed by fixing the error.

### Root Cause
The CSS was trying to use a `border-border` class in the `@apply` directive, but this class doesn't exist in our Tailwind configuration. While we defined a `--border` CSS variable, we didn't create a corresponding Tailwind class for it.

### Resolution
1. Updated the CSS in globals.css from:
   ```css
   * {
     @apply border-border;
   }
   ```
   to:
   ```css
   * {
     @apply border-[hsl(var(--border))];
   }
   ```

2. This change uses Tailwind's arbitrary value syntax to directly apply the HSL color value from our CSS variable.

### Prevention
To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Ensure all classes used in `@apply` directives are properly defined in the Tailwind configuration
2. Use arbitrary value syntax (`[value]`) when applying CSS variables directly
3. Consider creating explicit Tailwind classes for commonly used CSS variables

### Related Design System Decision
This issue relates to our design system implementation documented in ui_ux.md. The resolution reinforces our approach of using CSS variables for theming while ensuring proper integration with Tailwind's utility classes.

## CSS Background Class Error

### Issue Description
**Date**: [Current Date]  
**Status**: Resolved  
**Priority**: High  
**File**: src/app/globals.css

The application failed to build with the following error:

```
Syntax error: /Users/victorwilson/Desktop/projects/personal/re-portfolio-management/src/app/globals.css The `bg-background` class does not exist. If `bg-background` is a custom class, make sure it is defined within a `@layer` directive.
```

This error occurred during the build process and can only be dismissed by fixing the error.

### Root Cause
Similar to the previous border-border error, the CSS was trying to use a `bg-background` class in the `@apply` directive, but this class doesn't exist in our Tailwind configuration. While we defined a `--background` CSS variable, we didn't create a corresponding Tailwind class for it.

### Resolution
1. Updated the CSS in globals.css from:
   ```css
   body {
     @apply bg-background text-foreground;
     font-feature-settings: "rlig" 1, "calt" 1;
   }
   ```
   to:
   ```css
   body {
     @apply bg-[hsl(var(--background))] text-[hsl(var(--foreground))];
     font-feature-settings: "rlig" 1, "calt" 1;
   }
   ```

2. This change uses Tailwind's arbitrary value syntax to directly apply the HSL color values from our CSS variables.

### Prevention
To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Use arbitrary value syntax (`[value]`) for all CSS variable references in Tailwind classes
2. Ensure consistent approach to CSS variable usage throughout the application
3. Consider creating a utility function or component to standardize the application of CSS variables

### Related Design System Decision
This issue relates to our design system implementation documented in ui_ux.md. The resolution reinforces our approach of using CSS variables for theming while ensuring proper integration with Tailwind's utility classes. We should consider updating our design system documentation to explicitly mention the use of arbitrary value syntax for CSS variables.

## React Query Client Error

### Issue Description
**Date**: [Current Date]  
**Status**: Resolved  
**Priority**: High  
**File**: src/app/hooks/useProperties.ts

The application failed with the following error:

```
Unhandled Runtime Error
Error: No QueryClient set, use QueryClientProvider to set one

Source
src/app/hooks/useProperties.ts (43:36) @ useQueryClient

  41 |
  42 | export function useProperties() {
> 43 | const queryClient = useQueryClient();
     |                                  ^
  44 |
  45 | const { data: properties, isLoading, error } = useQuery({
  46 |   queryKey: ["properties"],
```

This error occurred during runtime and prevented the application from functioning properly.

### Root Cause
The error was occurring because we were using React Query hooks (`useQueryClient` and `useQuery`) without properly setting up the `QueryClientProvider` in our application. React Query requires a `QueryClientProvider` to be present in the component tree above any components that use React Query hooks.

### Resolution
1. Updated the providers.tsx file to include both ThemeProvider and QueryClientProvider:
   ```tsx
   "use client";
   
   import { ThemeProvider } from "next-themes";
   import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "@tanstack/react-query";
   import { useState } from "react";
   
   export default function Providers({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
     const [queryClient] = useState(() => new QueryClient());
   
     return (
       <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
         <ThemeProvider
           attribute="class"
           defaultTheme="dark"
           enableSystem
           disableTransitionOnChange
         >
           {children}
         </ThemeProvider>
       </QueryClientProvider>
     );
   }
   ```

2. This change ensures that all components in the application have access to the React Query client.

### Prevention
To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Always set up required providers at the root of the application
2. Document all required providers in the project documentation
3. Consider creating a checklist for new features that require specific providers

### Related Architectural Decision
This issue relates to our architectural decision to use React Query for data fetching. The resolution reinforces our approach of centralizing data fetching logic in custom hooks while ensuring proper provider setup for these hooks to function correctly.

## Property Form UX Issues

### Issue: Poor Property Form User Experience
- **Status:** In Progress
- **Priority:** High
- **Description:** The property entry form has several UX issues that make it difficult to use:
  - Text contrast issues: White text on white background in input fields
  - Inconsistent grid system: Form layout doesn't follow a clean, consistent grid
  - Lack of helper text and hints: No guidance for users on how to fill out the form
  - Dropdown styling issues: Property type dropdown has styling and contrast problems
  - No visual indication of required fields
  - No clear error handling or validation feedback
  - White shadowing/glow effect when opening the form
  - Property type dropdown still has poor contrast and usability
  - Entire form appears white with no proper contrast against the background
- **Impact:** Users struggle to enter property information correctly, leading to frustration and potential data entry errors
- **Solution:** Implement comprehensive form improvements including:
  - Complete overhaul of form styling using direct CSS instead of Tailwind classes
  - Fix text contrast in all input fields by using proper text color classes
  - Implement a consistent grid system for form layout
  - Add helper text and hints for each field
  - Improve dropdown styling and usability with proper contrast
  - Add visual indicators for required fields
  - Enhance error handling and validation feedback
  - Remove white shadowing/glow effect by fixing CSS classes
  - Ensure proper styling for the property type dropdown
  - Use CSS variables directly instead of Tailwind classes for better control
- **Related Components:** PropertyForm.tsx, NewPropertyPage.tsx
- **Assigned To:** UI/UX Team
- **Target Resolution:** Sprint 3

## Property Save and Display Fix

### Issue Description
**Date**: [Current Date]  
**Status**: Resolved  
**Priority**: High  
**Component**: Multiple (API, Hooks, UI)

Properties were not being saved or displayed on the dashboard after creation. This was caused by several issues:
1. In-memory storage in the API route
2. Improper cache invalidation in React Query
3. Basic error handling in the UI

### Root Cause
1. The API route was using in-memory storage (`const properties: Property[] = []`), which meant data was lost on server restart
2. The React Query cache wasn't being properly updated after property creation
3. Error handling was basic and didn't provide good feedback to users

### Resolution
1. **API Route Improvements**:
   - Implemented file-based storage for persistence
   - Added comprehensive error handling
   - Added logging for debugging
   - Prepared for future database integration

2. **React Query Improvements**:
   - Set `staleTime: 0` to always fetch fresh data
   - Added cache control headers to prevent browser caching
   - Implemented optimistic updates for better UX
   - Added proper error handling and type safety
   - Improved cache management with forced refetching
   - Added refetchOnMount and refetchOnWindowFocus options

3. **UI Improvements**:
   - Added loading spinner
   - Improved error state with retry button
   - Added empty state with call-to-action
   - Wrapped list in Card component for consistent styling

### Prevention
To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Always implement proper error handling at all layers
2. Use optimistic updates for better UX
3. Provide clear feedback to users during loading and error states
4. Use persistent storage solutions instead of in-memory storage
5. Implement proper cache control headers for API requests
6. Configure React Query to refetch data when components mount or window regains focus

### Related Architectural Decision
This fix aligns with our architectural decisions regarding:
- Client-Server Component Architecture
- State Management with React Query
- Error Handling and User Feedback
- UI Component Consistency
- Data Persistence

### Implementation Details
1. **File-based Storage**:
   - Created a `data` directory in the project root
   - Implemented `properties.json` file for storing property data
   - Added helper functions for reading and writing to the file
   - Ensured the data directory and file exist before operations

2. **React Query Configuration**:
   - Added cache control headers to prevent browser caching
   - Set `refetchOnMount: true` to ensure fresh data when components mount
   - Set `refetchOnWindowFocus: true` to refresh data when the window regains focus
   - Implemented both optimistic updates and forced refetching for reliability

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Added comprehensive error handling in the API route
   - Improved error messages in the UI
   - Added retry functionality for failed requests

## Dashboard Metrics Fix

### Issue Description
**Date**: [Current Date]  
**Status**: Resolved  
**Priority**: High  
**Component**: Dashboard, API, Hooks

The dashboard metrics were not reading from the database, showing $0 for total value even after properties were created with values.

### Root Cause
1. The dashboard was using hardcoded values instead of fetching real data from the database
2. No API endpoint existed to calculate and return dashboard metrics
3. No React hook was available to fetch and manage dashboard metrics data

### Resolution
1. Created a new API endpoint `/api/dashboard/metrics` that calculates:
   - Total number of properties
   - Total portfolio value (sum of all property market values)
   - Monthly income (sum of income transactions for the current month)
   - Number of active repairs (repairs with status "PENDING" or "IN_PROGRESS")
2. Implemented a new React hook `useDashboardMetrics` to fetch and manage dashboard metrics data
3. Updated the dashboard page to:
   - Use the new metrics hook
   - Display real-time data from the database
   - Show loading states with skeleton UI
   - Handle and display errors appropriately
   - Format numbers with proper currency formatting

### Prevention
To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Always implement real data fetching for metrics and summaries
2. Create dedicated API endpoints for data aggregation
3. Use React Query for data fetching and caching
4. Implement proper loading states and error handling
5. Format numbers appropriately for display

### Related Architectural Decision
This fix aligns with our decision to use React Query for data fetching and caching, as documented in the architecture.md file.

## Transaction Creation Error

### Issue
When attempting to create a transaction, the following error occurs:

```
src/app/transactions/components/TransactionForm.tsx (62:14) @ Object.mutationFn

  60 | if (!response.ok) {
  61 |   const errorData = await response.json();
> 62 |   throw new Error(errorData.error || 'Failed to create transaction');
     |        ^
  63 | }
  64 | 
  65 | return response.json();
```

### Root Cause
The error occurs in the transaction creation mutation function. The issue is that the API response is being parsed twice:
1. First in the error handling block: `const errorData = await response.json();`
2. Then again in the return statement: `return response.json();`

This is problematic because the response body can only be read once. After the first `response.json()` call, the response stream is consumed and cannot be read again.

### Solution
We need to modify the error handling in the transaction creation mutation to avoid parsing the response body twice. We should either:
1. Store the parsed response in a variable and reuse it, or
2. Clone the response before parsing it in the error handling block

### Implementation
We implemented the first approach by storing the parsed response in a variable and reusing it:

```tsx
const createTransaction = useMutation({
  mutationFn: async (data: TransactionFormData) => {
    const response = await fetch('/api/transactions', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(data),
    });
    
    const responseData = await response.json();
    
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(responseData.error || 'Failed to create transaction');
    }
    
    return responseData;
  },
  // ... rest of the mutation config
});
```

### Status
тЬЕ Resolved

### Related Architectural Decision
This fix aligns with our best practices for handling API responses in React Query mutations, as documented in the documentation.md file.
