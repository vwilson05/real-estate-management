## Module Import Error in PropertyList Component

### Issue Description
**Date**: [Current Date]  
**Status**: Resolved  
**Priority**: High  
**Component**: PropertyList.tsx

The application failed to compile with the following error:

```
Failed to compile
./src/app/properties/components/PropertyList.tsx:5:0
Module not found: Can't resolve '../../../hooks/useProperties'
  3 | import { Table, TableHead, TableRow, TableHeaderCell, TableBody, TableCell, Button } from "@tremor/react";
  4 | import Link from "next/link";
> 5 | import { useProperties, Property } from "../../../hooks/useProperties";
  6 |
  7 | export default function PropertyList() {
  8 |   const { properties, isLoading, error } = useProperties();
```

This error occurred during the build process and can only be dismissed by fixing the error.

### Root Cause
The import path for the `useProperties` hook was incorrect. The component was trying to import from `../../../hooks/useProperties`, but the actual path should be `../../hooks/useProperties` since the hooks directory is at the app level, not at the properties level.

### Resolution
1. Updated the import path in PropertyList.tsx from:
   ```typescript
   import { useProperties, Property } from "../../../hooks/useProperties";
   ```
   to:
   ```typescript
   import { useProperties, Property } from "../../hooks/useProperties";
   ```

2. This change aligns with our architectural decision to keep hooks at the app level for better organization and reusability.

### Prevention
To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Follow the established project structure where hooks are placed in the app-level hooks directory
2. Use relative imports carefully, counting directory levels correctly
3. Consider using path aliases in tsconfig.json for more reliable imports

### Related Architectural Decision
This issue relates to our decision documented in decisions.md regarding the organization of hooks and client components. The resolution reinforces our approach of keeping hooks at the app level for better maintainability and reusability.

## Module Import Error in Transactions Page

### Issue Description
**Date**: [Current Date]  
**Status**: In Progress  
**Priority**: High  
**Component**: transactions/page.tsx

The application failed to compile with the following error:

```
тип ./src/app/transactions/page.tsx:1:0
Module not found: Can't resolve '../components/transactions/TransactionList'
> 1 | import TransactionList from '../components/transactions/TransactionList';
  2 | import TransactionForm from '../components/transactions/TransactionForm';
  3 |
  4 | export default function TransactionsPage() {
```

This error occurred during the build process and can only be dismissed by fixing the error.

### Root Cause
The import path for the `TransactionList` component is incorrect. The component is trying to import from `../components/transactions/TransactionList`, but this path doesn't exist in the project structure. Based on our project structure, components should be organized within their respective feature directories.

### Resolution
1. Create the necessary directory structure:
   ```
   src/app/transactions/components/
   ```

2. Create the TransactionList component in the correct location:
   ```
   src/app/transactions/components/TransactionList.tsx
   ```

3. Update the import path in transactions/page.tsx from:
   ```typescript
   import TransactionList from '../components/transactions/TransactionList';
   ```
   to:
   ```typescript
   import TransactionList from './components/TransactionList';
   ```

4. Similarly, update the import path for TransactionForm:
   ```typescript
   import TransactionForm from './components/TransactionForm';
   ```

### Prevention
To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Follow the established project structure where components are placed in their respective feature directories
2. Use consistent import paths across the application
3. Consider using path aliases in tsconfig.json for more reliable imports

### Related Architectural Decision
This issue relates to our decision documented in decisions.md regarding the organization of components. The resolution reinforces our approach of keeping components within their respective feature directories for better maintainability and organization.
